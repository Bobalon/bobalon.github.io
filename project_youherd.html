		<strong>“You Herd Me”</strong> is a top-down sheep herding game. Your goal is to guide as many sheep as possible to the end of the level, while activating bridges and preventing wolves from eating them. <!--The two players control distinct characters - the shepherd and his dog. The dog is faster and can bark to repel sheep from a greater distance. The shepherd can repel wolves with a torch and beckon sheep towards him with a bell - but never both at the same time. There’s some light platforming involved.-->
		Two players cooperate and control distinct characters.

		A four week long Futuregames project. My team had two Project Managers, two Programmers, and two Designers - one of which was me. The game was required to be 3D, to be local co-op, and to have puzzles.
<br><br>I drew a brief explanation of the controls and gameplay loop:

	  We landed on sheep herding early and by day two I was already producing concept art. Most of the early design was collaborative, involving the entire team.<br><br>
   Both me and the other designer were comfortable with 3D, so we went in with the assumption that we’d make assets of our own. To make this easier, the early concept sketches were drawn with basic shapes in mind.

We had to produce a poster within the first week, to get it printed in time for the end of the project. Halfway through week one, we figured there was enough in the GDD for me to focus on the poster design, while the other designer did level mockups in Blender.
<br><br>   I produced 13 rough poster sketches. I followed up with an A2 version of the winning concept.

Since it was finished and sent for printing in the first week, there are at least two things in the poster that don’t match the final game. First, there were subtle changes to the shepherd’s design. More importantly, the sheep are seen running off the edge of the map - something that was still present in the early design. This was abandoned as we started prototyping and testing, since it proved difficult to allow the sheep to run off the level without making the game feel unfair and not fun to play.
<br><br>
After the first week, there was a clearer division of labour. I ended up designing most of the menu and UI assets, including game over and victory screens. The other designer did most of the level design. We collaborated on character assets, with him making meshes and me texturing.

I made a few simple UI elements for keeping track of health and sheep early in the process. I also made a custom font for the numbers, to make implementation easier.
<br><br>
<em>My biggest regret</em> with this project is the bar that shows how many sheep you need in order to finish the level. It was a placeholder design we never had time to replace, and in hindsight I don’t think we even needed a permanent UI element for it. We could’ve just made the sheep cloud <em>move and make a noise</em> when you had enough sheep saved.

At the end of the level you’re awarded between 1-3 apples depending on the number of sheep you’ve successfully herded. The animation for apples popping in is 3 frames per apple - no apple, big apple, smaller final apple.

We had a running joke from some of the early untextured sheep meshes that there should be rare purple sheep in the game. I don’t remember if we actually implemented the one in a thousand chance of spawning a purple sheep. Regardless, there is a texture for it.

The original main menu concept was 2D, meant to evoke the poster. We later decided to make it 3D, to show off the assets we’d worked on, since you couldn’t see them very well from the top-down perspective of gameplay. Making it 3D allowed us to have character assets walking across the screen and even do dynamic transitions.
<br><br>
I didn’t personally implement the main menu, but I created the buttons and sketched out the general design.
