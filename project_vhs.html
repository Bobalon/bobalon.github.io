		<strong>“The Lost VHS Tape”</strong> is a short week and a half project put together using Adventure Creator for Unity. Your spaceship is under attack and the Captain is too bored to help coordinate your escape efforts. Only one thing helps - watching his favourite show on VHS. You control Lt. Bradwell Jenkins Jr. as he searches the ship for the tape.

		My team was made up of five people. We were limited to a collection of assets bought by Futuregames. My primary role was <strong>writing and Narrative Design</strong>. For the sake of consistency, I ended up writing at least 90% of the ingame text.

We spent the first half a week familiarizing ourselves with Adventure Creator and individually brainstorming ideas. These are my personal brainstorm sketches:

	  The following Monday we voted on our favourites. The bored Captain was chosen. Me and one of my teammates started putting together a basic story flow and a list of characters. We chose Figma as our platform for sharing information. We figured it would be easier to visualise dialogue trees and interaction text for environments in something like Figma or Miro than with a standard document.
   <br><br>
   This is what it looked like towards the end:

	  The other half of the team started building rooms in Unity. I drew a simple storyboard for a potential intro cutscene so the Unity part of the team could start looking into how viable it was.

	  After that, I moved on to writing dialogue trees and computer logs. I actively participated in discussions about puzzle design and graphics, but my primary focus was how these would affect the writing.
	  <br><br>
	  Below are three screenshots of the Figma dialogue trees. The third one is from the Captain's laptop.

	  I also drew a cutscene storyboard for the ending, based on a rough concept by another team mate. After the success of the intro cutscene, we felt it was fitting to end with one.

	  When the dialogue was more or less finished, I moved on to interaction text for the environment and lines for when you use items on specific people. A lot of this did not get implemented, due to time constraints and having scrapped the “examine” command in favour of a more streamlined “clicking always means interact” type of approach.

	  There were a few adjustments to dialogue along the way, particularly when the decision was made to put the VHS in the engine room. Previously the engine room had been open from the start (and the VHS tape was in the Captain’s office) and I’d written the dialogue with the assumption that we’d place some other important inventory item there.
<br><br>
  Towards the end, we made some difficult decisions and killed a few darlings. Having decided that the narrative was the strength of the project, and seeing as the text was more or less finished, most of the cuts were puzzles. The biggest loss, I think, was the pass code for the Captain’s office, since we all liked the idea that you could look inside without being able to enter.
