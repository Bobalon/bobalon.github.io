		<strong>“Alltarach”</strong> is a branching illustrated novel set in a semi-fantastical version of 6th century Ireland - a transitional period, a generation after the passing of the Apostle Patrick. You follow the perspective of <strong>Bríd</strong>, a teenage orphan from a rocky island off the west coast. Her brother didn’t wake her this morning.
<br><br>
		<strong>A personal project where I teamed up with a writer.</strong> I developed the visual style and created all of the art assets, while the writer wrote the text and the code. We collaborated on things that weren’t strictly in those categories, including a lot of the design.
<br><br>
		The full game is not released yet, but you can play the first act <a href="https://wildisland.itch.io/alltarach?password=alltarach">here</a>.

	  At first, my primary role was drawing characters. I would read the text as it developed, then sketch out my interpretation of the characters involved, sometimes in several iterations. This, in turn, influenced the development of the text.
	  <br><br>
	  Next I started looking for a unifying style and colour scheme. I was aiming for a storybook vibe. I delved into some kind of pop-art style at one point, but it felt too modern for what I was trying to evoke.

	  I finally landed on clear lineart with a rough coat of semi-monochrome paint, with different backdrop patterns and palettes for different chapters to suit the time, location, and themes.
<br><br>
The first chapter, on the island, is pale blue and bluish green. It’s meant to evoke the cold, the rocks, the ocean, and the protagonist’s sense of disconnect and abandonment.

	  With general style down, I started working on the logo. After sketching in Procreate, I used Illustrator for lineart, then Clipstudio Paint for colours. I based the font on the earliest forms of insular script I could find, with the same word in Ogham underneath. The part that took the longest was figuring out what to put inside the initial letter. I inserted a rough sketch of an abstract púca drawing I’d seen on a book cover, just to get a sense of what it might look like. Then I started brainstorming.
<br><br>
I explored other ideas, but always came back to the púca. The final version is a creature I imagined to be somewhere between a badger and a horse, surrounded by dots and lines. I made an Illustrator version of it inside the logo and found that some people mistook it for a boat leaving an island. While unintentional, it’s not a terrible alternate meaning.

	  The last thing I designed before returning to art assets for the story were the buttons for inventory and settings at the bottom of the screen. I wanted something that would fit the time period and aesthetic. It also felt important that they be images, so they wouldn’t distract from the text that makes up the bulk of the game. 
	  <br><br>
	  The bag was simple enough - I just looked for really old bags. The “settings” were more complicated. The universal icon for settings is a cog - but cogs are too modern. I thought of water wheels - similar, but older. I painted them both in greyscale, so they’d never clash with the chapter colour scheme.
